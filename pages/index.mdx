![Hello](/cellsatwar_nobg.png) 

After many years of trying to adapt to educational innovations of the 21st Century, 
educators will soon be looking into the not-too-distant future to consider what 
modern learning in post-secondary education will look like in the 22nd Century. 
Technological advances will continue to transform the landscape of the classroom. 
The use of digital games, although a source of controversy and debate, will 
prove to be highly effective instructional tools that will promote problem solving 
and critical thinking skills. Their use has already started to change the structure 
of the class in the elementary classroom as they serve to energize and engage 
students in their learning and improve conceptual understandings, creativity, 
and imagination. The traditional construct of the classroom has started to evolve, 
embracing a new way in which knowledge, skills, and attitudes can be acquired.

## What is Cells at War?

‘Cells at War’ is a collection of educational video games developed through 
interdisciplinary efforts that reinforces the notion that video games are 
highly effective tools used to enhance instructional methods and 
engage students in STEAM classrooms.
