The initial focus of this study was to create and implement a biological video game 
that focused on a single gene disease, which served as a vehicle to teach 
cellular and molecular biology concepts.

In 2021, the BIO1A03 instructional team partnered up with the George Brown 
College School of Design, and received support from CEWIL Canada 
(Co-operative Education and Work-Integrated Learning Canada), to design 
and implement an educational biological video game that could be used as 
an instructional and engaging teaching tool in BIO1A03. A small cohort of
McMaster Univeristy Biology students and supervising professors, 
as well as game designers, programmers, animators, audio engineers, 
and artists from the George Brown College School of Design were 
selected to pilot this work-integrated learning project.

The theme for the game was centred around single-gene diseases. 
Biology students from McMaster University were responsible for 
selecting and researching a specific single-gene disease. 
This information was exchanged with students from George Brown College, 
who in-turn provided a wealth of knowledge on how to turn these static, 
difficult to understand concepts into engaging gameplay mechanics. 
The disease that was selected was Pompe disease, 
a rare genetic disease that causes skeletal 
and cardiac muscle weakness due to the accumulation of glycogen within lysosomes.
