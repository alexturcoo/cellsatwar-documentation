# Cells vs Pompe Disease

![Hello](/asset6.png) 

Ever fallen asleep in biology class? We're sure you have. 

Cells vs Pompe Disease takes students on an interactive and engaging journey inside a human cell.
Students are able to learn important cellular and molecular biology concepts such as transcription, translation,
and mutation, through examining a rare genetic disease called Pompe Disease. Students have the ability to visualize
important biological processess in both healthy and diseased cells, which helps to better understand genetic mutation,
and the numerous downstream effects on trancription and translation. Ultimately, students are able to see how molecular mishaps 
that arise in healthy cells lead to diseased cells.
