# Cells vs Type 1 Diabetes

![Hello](/t1dthumb.png) 

Cells vs. Type 1 Diabetes allows players to gain an in-depth understanding of the endocrine 
function of the pancreas by seeing the role of insulin within the bloodstream. 
In this Tamagotchi™️-style game, players take care of their avatar by feeding their 
character and simultaneously monitoring blood sugar levels. As players eat foods, 
insulin will be automatically released in a healthy pancreatic system, and players 
will need to drag insulin to receptors to activate glucose channels so glucose can 
reach cells. After learning about how the healthy pancreatic system works, players 
gain an understanding of what a day in the life of a type 1 diabetic is like, by observing 
impacts of impaired insulin production in the bloodstream, and also exploring how treatments 
like insulin injections work. Players get to explore different required insulin doses 
for foods with different carbohydrate contents, and how factors including intensities 
of daily activities and exercise impact blood sugar regulations.
