# Physics Phood Phestival

![Hello](/phood.png) 

The Physics Phood Phestival (P3) is a place players can visit to develop formulas and test them against natural phenomena. 
Once the player enters the phestival they are guided to build the equation for the rise of a fluid in a thin tube known 
as the “capillary rise” equation. The formula is built using dimensional analysis, and combining the dimensions associated 
with various parameters like the density, surface tension and the radius of a tube. After developing the equation for 
capillary rise, which governs transpiration in plants and even the way the wick of a candle draws up molten wax, 
the player can exit into another world where they have to make it through a series of ports. The only way to make it 
through is by properly applying the equation for capillary rise to exit from one port into another. Through the game 
the players learn dimensional analysis and the application of dimensionality to physical phenomena.
